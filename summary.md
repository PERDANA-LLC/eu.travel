Here is the explanation of that job post in simple language:

### **The Project: A Smart Helper for Europe Trips**

Imagine you want to go on a vacation to Europe. Starting soon, the European government will require travelers to fill out a special "permission slip" online (called ETIAS) before they can visit.

Sometimes, government forms are confusing and easy to mess up. This person wants to build a website that acts like a **smart tutor** to help travelers get ready.

**How the website will work:**
1.  **The Quiz:** It asks you questions to see if you are allowed to travel.
2.  **The Smart Form:** As you type in your information, the website checks for mistakes. If you spell something wrong or skip a box, it tells you right away.
3.  **The Finish Line:** Once your "practice form" looks perfect, the website sends you to the **real** government website to turn it in. (The helper website doesn't send it for you; it just makes sure you’re ready.)
4.  **The Cost:** People will pay money to use this helper tool because it makes the process less stressful.

### **The Job Offer:**
*   **Who they want:** They aren't looking for just one person. They want a whole team of professional computer builders (an "agency") who can be their long-term partners.
*   **The Pay:** They are offering **$30,000** to the team that can build the whole thing.
*   **The Rules:** The most important rule is that the website **cannot** turn in the forms for the users. It is only there to help them prepare and then show them where the official website is.

### **What the builders need to do:**
*   Make the website look nice and easy to use.
*   Write the "brain" of the site so it knows all the travel rules.
*   Make sure the payment system (where people pay to use the tool) is safe and secure.
