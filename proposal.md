# Upwork Proposal: Automated EU Travel Authorization Assistance Platform

**Subject: Expert SaaS Developer with a Ready-to-Deploy ETIAS Platform**

Dear Client,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in your project to build an automated EU travel authorization assistance platform. After carefully reviewing your requirements, I am confident that I am the ideal candidate for this long-term partnership. In fact, I have already built a comprehensive and fully functional SaaS platform that mirrors your project description almost exactly.

I invite you to explore my live application, **ETIAS Assist**, at [https://eu-travel.thomasperdana.com](https://eu-travel.thomasperdana.com). This platform demonstrates my expertise in all the areas you require, from product architecture to secure payment integration and a trust-focused UX. I am a newcomer to Upwork, but I am a seasoned developer with a passion for building high-quality SaaS products. I am willing to do whatever it takes to earn your trust and deliver an exceptional platform that exceeds your expectations.

Below, I have addressed your specific questions:

### 1. Please share links to 2–3 real SaaS platforms your team has built (live or in production). Briefly explain your role.

As an individual developer, I handle all aspects of the projects I undertake. My most relevant project is the **ETIAS Assist** platform, which I conceived, designed, and built from the ground up. It is a complete, production-ready SaaS application that aligns perfectly with your requirements.

*   **Live Application:** [https://eu-travel.thomasperdana.com](https://eu-travel.thomasperdana.com)
*   **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/PERDANA-LLC/etias-assist](https://github.com/PERDANA-LLC/etias-assist)
*   **Admin Login:** You can explore the comprehensive admin dashboard at [https://eu-travel.thomasperdana.com/admin/login](https://eu-travel.thomasperdana.com/admin/login) with the following credentials:
    *   **Username:** `superadmin@guest.com`
    *   **Password:** `guest.com@superadmin1`

My role in this project was all-encompassing, including:

*   **Product Architect:** I designed the entire system, from the database schema to the API and frontend architecture.
*   **Full-Stack Developer:** I developed both the frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and the backend (Node.js, Python).
*   **UX/UI Designer:** I created the clean, modern, and trust-focused user interface using Shadcn and a custom theme.
*   **DevOps Engineer:** I deployed and manage the application on Vercel.

### 2. How would you design automation-first eligibility checks and real-time validation for a complex multi-step form?

My approach, as implemented in the ETIAS Assist platform, is to create a seamless and intelligent user experience that minimizes errors and builds user confidence. Here’s how I would design the automation and validation:

*   **Smart Guided Forms:** I break down complex forms into logical, manageable steps. In ETIAS Assist, the application is a 5-step process, and the eligibility check is a 4-step process. This prevents users from feeling overwhelmed.
*   **Real-Time, Inline Validation:** As users fill out the forms, each field is validated in real-time. This immediate feedback prevents errors before the user even moves to the next step. For example, I validate email formats, passport number formats, and date ranges on the fly.
*   **Conditional Logic:** The forms are dynamic. For instance, the questions in the eligibility check determine whether the user should proceed to the full application. This automation-first approach ensures that only eligible users proceed, improving conversion rates.
*   **Backend Validation:** In addition to frontend validation, I implement robust backend validation to ensure data integrity and security before it is saved to the database.

### 3. Have you built platforms involving complex forms, compliance rules, fintech, travel, or gov-adjacent logic? If yes, explain briefly.

Yes, the ETIAS Assist platform is a prime example of my experience in all these areas:

*   **Complex Forms:** The platform features a multi-step application form that collects personal, passport, travel, and background information, all with real-time validation.
*   **Compliance Rules:** The platform is designed with GDPR in mind, ensuring that user data is handled securely and transparently. The payment system is PCI DSS compliant through Stripe.
*   **Fintech:** I have integrated a secure payment system using Stripe, allowing for credit/debit card, Apple Pay, and Google Pay transactions.
*   **Travel & Gov-Adjacent Logic:** The entire platform is built around the ETIAS program, a government travel authorization system. This required a deep understanding of the eligibility rules, application process, and the critical compliance requirement of not submitting the application on the user's behalf.

### 4. Confirm that you understand this platform must NOT submit applications on behalf of users, and will redirect users to the official EU ETIAS website for final submission.

I confirm that I completely understand this critical requirement. The ETIAS Assist platform is designed as a preparation and assistance tool. After the user completes the guided form and payment, they are explicitly instructed to proceed to the official EU ETIAS website to submit their application. The platform provides a redirect link to the official site, but it does not, and will not, submit any data on the user's behalf.

### 5. Who will be working on this project (roles only — e.g., product manager, frontend, backend, QA)?

As an experienced and dedicated individual, I will be personally responsible for all aspects of this project. I will be your single point of contact and will fulfill the following roles:

*   **Product Manager**
*   **UX/UI Designer**
*   **Frontend Developer**
*   **Backend Developer**
*   **QA Engineer**

I am confident in my ability to manage the entire project lifecycle and deliver a high-quality product, as demonstrated by my existing ETIAS Assist platform. I am located in Orlando, Florida, and I am available to work in your preferred time zone.

I am incredibly excited about the possibility of working with you and am eager to demonstrate how my existing platform can be adapted and customized to your exact specifications. I am available for a call at your earliest convenience to discuss your project in more detail and provide a live walkthrough of the ETIAS Assist admin dashboard.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Thomas Perdana
